# LeetCode Problem: [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

## Problem Description

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

## Solution Approach

We can use bit manipulation to count the number of set bits (bits with value 1) in the given integer. We iterate through each bit of the integer, check if it is set (equals 1), and increment a counter if it is set.

## Java Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            count += (n & 1);
            n = n >> 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1). Since the integer size is fixed (32 bits), the time complexity remains constant.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The space complexity is constant as we are using only a fixed amount of memory.

## Code Explanation

- We initialize a counter variable `count` to store the number of set bits.
- We iterate through each bit of the integer (32 bits for an integer) using a loop.
- In each iteration, we check if the least significant bit (LSB) of the integer is set (equals 1) using the bitwise AND operation with 1.
- If the LSB is set, we increment the `count` variable.
- We then right shift the integer by 1 bit to consider the next bit.
- We repeat this process for all 32 bits of the integer.
- Finally, we return the count of set bits, which represents the Hamming weight of the integer.
