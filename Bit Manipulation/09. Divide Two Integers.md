# LeetCode Problem: [29. Divide Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/)

## Problem Description

Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `truncate(8.345) = 8` and `truncate(-2.7335) = -2`.

Note:
- Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. For this problem, assume that your function returns 2^31 − 1 when the division result overflows.

## Solution Approach

To perform integer division without using multiplication, division, and mod operators, we can use bit manipulation techniques.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        long quotient = 0;
        int sign = 1;
        int max = Integer.MAX_VALUE, min = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        if (dividend < 0 && divisor > 0 || dividend > 0 && divisor < 0)
            sign = -1;

        long dd = (long) dividend, dv = (long) divisor;
        dd = Math.abs(dd);
        dv = Math.abs(dv);
        while (dd >= dv) {
            int shift = 0;
            while (dd >= (dv << shift))
                shift++;
            quotient += (long) 1l << (shift - 1);
            dd -= dv << (shift - 1);
        }
        if (sign == 1) {
            if (quotient > max)
                return max;
            return (int) quotient;
        } else {
            if ((~quotient) + 1 < min)
                return min;
            return (int) (~quotient) + 1;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log(dividend)), where dividend is the value of the dividend. The time complexity is determined by the number of bits required to represent the dividend.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Explanation
- We handle the sign of the quotient.
- We use long data types for `dividend`, `divisor`, and `quotient` to handle integer overflow.
- We repeatedly subtract `divisor` from `dividend` until `dividend` is less than `divisor`.
- We keep track of the number of shifts required to perform the subtraction.
- Finally, we return the quotient while considering the sign and overflow conditions.
