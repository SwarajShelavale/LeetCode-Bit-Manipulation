# LeetCode Problem: 371.[Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)

## Solution Approach

To compute the sum of two integers without using the '+' operator, we can use bitwise operations. The logic involves simulating the addition process using bitwise XOR (^) and bitwise AND (&) operations.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int carry = a & b;
            a = a ^ b;
            b = carry << 1;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log(max(a, b))), where a and b are the input integers. The time complexity is determined by the number of bits required to represent the maximum of the two numbers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input.

## Code Explanation
-  We use a while loop to keep adding the carry and the result of the XOR operation until there is no carry left.
-  In each iteration, we calculate the carry by performing a bitwise AND operation between a and b.
-  Then, we update a by performing a bitwise XOR operation between a and b, which gives the sum without considering the carry.
-  Next, we update b by left shifting the carry by 1 bit, which will be added to a in the next iteration.
-  We repeat this process until there is no carry left, at which point we return the final sum.
