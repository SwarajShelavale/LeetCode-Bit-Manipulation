# LeetCode Problem: [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

## Solution Approach

To find the single number in the given array, we can use the bitwise XOR (^) operation. The XOR operation has the property that if we XOR a number with itself, the result is 0. Therefore, XORing all the numbers in the array will cancel out pairs of the same number, leaving only the single number.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int singleNumber = 0;
        for (int n : nums)
            singleNumber ^= n;
        return singleNumber;  
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space for the single variable `singleNumber`.

## Code Explanation
- We initialize the `singleNumber` variable to 0.
- We iterate through the array `nums`.
- For each element `n` in `nums`, we perform the bitwise XOR operation between `singleNumber` and `n`.
- At the end of the loop, `singleNumber` will hold the value of the single number in the array, as all pairs of the same number will cancel out, leaving only the single number.
- Finally, we return the value of `singleNumber`.
