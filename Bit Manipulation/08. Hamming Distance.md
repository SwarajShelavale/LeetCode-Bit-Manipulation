# LeetCode Problem: [461. Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/)

## Problem Description

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

## Solution Approach

To calculate the Hamming distance between two integers, we can compare their binary representations bit by bit and count the positions where they differ.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((x & (1 << i)) != (y & (1 << i)))
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as we iterate through the bits of the integers, which is constant (32 bits for an integer).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Explanation
- We iterate through the 32 bits of the integers `x` and `y`.
- At each bit position, we use bitwise AND operation to check if the corresponding bits are different.
- If the bits are different, we increment the count.
- Finally, we return the count as the Hamming distance between the two integers.
