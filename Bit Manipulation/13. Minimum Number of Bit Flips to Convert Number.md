# LeetCode Problem: [1461. Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-string-contains-all-binary-codes-of-size-k/)

## Problem Description

Given a binary string `s` and an integer `k`, return true if every binary code of length `k` is a substring of `s`. Otherwise, return false.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we need to check if all possible binary codes of size `k` exist as substrings of the given string `s`. We can achieve this by iterating through all possible binary codes of size `k` and checking if each one exists as a substring in `s`.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasAllCodes(String s, int k) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - k; i++) {
            set.add(s.substring(i, i + k));
        }
        return set.size() == (1 << k);
    }
}
```

## Code Explanation

- We use a HashSet to store unique binary codes of size `k` found in the string `s`.
- We iterate through all possible substrings of length `k` in the string `s` and add them to the HashSet.
- Finally, we return true if the size of the HashSet is equal to the total number of unique binary codes of size `k` (which is `2^k`), indicating that all binary codes of size `k` exist in the string `s`.
