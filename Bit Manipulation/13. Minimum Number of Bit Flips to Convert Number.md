# LeetCode Problem: [2220. Minimum Number of Bit Flips to Convert Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-bit-flips/)

## Problem Description

Given two integers `start` and `goal`, return the minimum number of bit flips required to convert `start` to `goal`. You can flip the rightmost or the leftmost bit of any integer in `start`.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we iterate through each bit of the integers `start` and `goal`. Whenever we encounter a bit that needs to be flipped, we increment the count of bit flips.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int mask = (1 << i);
            if (((start & mask) == 0 && (goal & mask) != 0) || ((start & mask) != 0 && (goal & mask) == 0))
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Code Explanation

- We initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of bit flips required.
- We iterate through each bit of the integers `start` and `goal`.
- For each bit position, we create a mask using the left shift operator to check the bit at that position.
- If the corresponding bits in `start` and `goal` are different, we increment the `count` since a flip is needed.
- Finally, we return the `count` representing the minimum number of bit flips required.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1). The loop iterates at most 32 times, considering the 32 bits in an integer.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of space.
