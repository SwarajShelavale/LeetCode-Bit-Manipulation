# LeetCode Problem: [260. Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

## Solution Approach

To find the two elements that appear only once in the array, we can use bitwise XOR operations. We first XOR all the elements to find the XOR of the two unique elements. Then, we find the lowest set bit in the XOR result and use it to separate the array into two groups. Finally, we XOR each group separately to find the two unique elements.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int singleNumber = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
            singleNumber ^= nums[i];

        singleNumber = singleNumber & ~(singleNumber - 1); // Find the lowest set bit

        int a = 0, b = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if ((singleNumber & nums[i]) != 0)
                a ^= nums[i];
            else
                b ^= nums[i];
        }

        return new int[]{a, b};
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array. We iterate through the array twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Explanation
- We XOR all the elements in the array to find the XOR of the two unique elements.
- We find the lowest set bit in the XOR result using the bitwise AND and bitwise NOT operations.
- We separate the array into two groups based on the lowest set bit, and then XOR each group separately to find the two unique elements.
- We return the array containing the two unique elements.
