# LeetCode Problem: [1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, you have to transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:

- Choose any non-negative integer `k`.
- Apply the following operations to `k` to create a new integer `k'`:
  - Flip the bits of `k`.
  - Replace the bits of `k` with the bits of `n`.
  - Return the minimum number of operations to transform `n` into 0.

## Solution Approach

To minimize the number of operations, we can use a recursive approach. We compute the number of operations required to transform `n` into 0 by recursively applying the operations described above.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    public int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) 
            return n;
        int count = 0;
        while ((1 << count) <= n) 
            count++;
        return ((1 << count) - 1) - minimumOneBitOperations(n - (1 << (count - 1)));
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the given integer. The time complexity is determined by the number of bits required to represent the integer.
- **Space Complexity**: O(log n), due to the recursive calls made during the computation.

## Code Explanation

- We recursively compute the number of operations required to transform `n` into 0.
- We determine the maximum power of 2 less than or equal to `n` to find the next operation.
- We subtract the value of the current operation from the input `n` and continue recursively until `n` becomes 0.
