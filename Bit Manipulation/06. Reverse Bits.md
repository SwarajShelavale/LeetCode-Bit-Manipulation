# LeetCode Problem: [190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

## Problem Description

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

## Solution Approach

To reverse the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer, we can use bitwise operations. We iterate through each bit of the input integer, extract the bit at the corresponding position, and construct the reversed integer.

## Java Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int reverseInteger = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((n & (1 << i)) != 0)
                reverseInteger = reverseInteger << 1 | 1;
            else
                reverseInteger = reverseInteger << 1;
        }
        return reverseInteger;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the number of iterations is constant (32 iterations for a 32-bit integer).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Explanation
- We iterate through each bit of the input integer from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
- For each bit, we use the bitwise AND operation to check if the bit is set (1) or not (0).
- If the bit is set, we set the corresponding bit in the reversed integer using the bitwise OR operation.
- If the bit is not set, we leave the corresponding bit in the reversed integer as 0.
- Finally, we return the reversed integer.
