# LeetCode Problem: [50. Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)

## Problem Description

Implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we use the binary exponentiation technique, also known as the fast power algorithm. This algorithm reduces the number of multiplication operations required to calculate the power by using binary representation and bit manipulation.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n < 0) {
            n = -n;
            x = 1 / x;
        }

        double pow = 1;

        while (n != 0) {
            if ((n & 1) != 0) {
                pow *= x;
            }
            x *= x;
            n >>>= 1;
        }

        return pow;
    }
}
```
## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the exponent. The time complexity arises from the binary exponentiation algorithm.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Explanation

- If the exponent `n` is negative, we make it positive and update `x` to be the reciprocal of `x`.
- We initialize the result `pow` to 1.
- We iterate through the bits of `n`.
  - If the current bit of `n` is 1, we multiply `pow` by `x`.
  - We update `x` by squaring it.
  - We right shift `n` by 1 bit to consider the next bit.
- We return the final result `pow`.
