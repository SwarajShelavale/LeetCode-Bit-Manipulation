# LeetCode Problem: [1734. Decode XORed Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-xored-permutation/)

## Problem Description

Given the integers `num1` and `num2`, find the integer `ans` where `ans = num1 ^ x`, and `x` is the value that minimizes the value of `ans`. Return `x`.

Note: `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

## Solution Approach

To minimize the value of the XOR operation `num1 ^ x`, we need to set the bits in `x` such that the result of the XOR operation is minimized. We iterate through the bits of `num1` and `num2` and set the bits in `x` accordingly.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimizeXor(int num1, int num2) {
        if (num1 == num2) 
            return num1;
		
        int bit = Integer.bitCount(num2);
		
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            int currBit = (num1 >> i) & 1;
            if (currBit == 1 && bit > 0) {
                ans |= (1 << i);
                bit--;
            }
        }
        
        // if bits to set are remaining, set the `LSB`
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if (bit == 0) break;
            int currBit = (ans >> i) & 1;
            if (currBit != 1) {
                ans |= (1 << i);
                bit--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the maximum number of bits to iterate over is 32, which is constant.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Explanation
- We count the number of set bits in `num2` to keep track of the bits to be set in `x`.
- We iterate through the bits of `num1` and set the bits in `x` such that the result of the XOR operation is minimized.
- If there are remaining bits to be set, we set them starting from the least significant bit (LSB).
- Finally, we return the minimized value of `ans`.
